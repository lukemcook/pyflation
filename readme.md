pyflation.py is a program that calculates the value of a given amount of U.S. dollars at a specific year. It prompts the user to enter the amount of dollars and the desired year. Using historical inflation data, the program then calculates the adjusted value of the dollars at the specified year, taking into account the effects of inflation. The calculated value is then displayed to the user.
